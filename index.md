## About

### Workshop Description

The workshop will demonstrate how to find, access, and work with GEDI and Icesat-2 data from the Earthdata Cloud. Participants will learn how to search for and download data from NASAâ€™s Earthdata Search Client, a graphical user interface (GUI) for search, discovery, and download application for also EOSDIS data assets. Participants will learn how to perform in-could data search, access, and processing routines where no data download is required, and data analysis can take place next to the data in the cloud.
